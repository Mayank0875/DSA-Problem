## Description

An exam is held in a large hall with an $n \times n$ seating chart (where $n$ is odd). The seats are indexed by row $i$ and column $j$ (from 1 to $n$). Due to a strange grading rule, the student sitting at $(i, j)$ receives a score of $i \times j$.The examiner needs to find the median score of all $n^2$ students to curve the grades.

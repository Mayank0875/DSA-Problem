## Title

Flight Departure Board

## Slug

flight-departure-board

## Difficulty

Easy

## Description

You are given a sorted list of flight departure times (as integers). A new flight with a `target` departure time is delayed and must be added to this list.

Your task is to find the index where this new flight should be inserted to keep the board sorted.
The index should be the first one with a time greater than or equal to the new flight's time.
If all flights are earlier, the new flight is placed at the end.


## Examples

### 1

#### Input

6 8
[2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12]


#### Output

3

#### Explanation

The first product with an ID greater than or equal to 8 is at index 3.

### 2

#### Input

6 6
[2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12]

#### Output

2

#### Explanation

No product has an ID equal to 6.
The first product with a larger ID (7) appears at index 2.

## Input Format

- The first line contains two integers n and target, where n = number of product IDs, and target = ID of the new product.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers — the sorted list of product IDs.

## Output Format

- Return a single integer — the index where the new product should be inserted.



## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ product_id, target ≤ 10^9
- The IDs are sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Description

An archaeologist has a tablet (`board`) with a grid of hieroglyphs (represented as letters). They need to find a specific `word`. The word might be written in a "snake-like" path, moving up, down, left, or right to adjacent cells. The path cannot cross itself, meaning the same cell cannot be used twice.

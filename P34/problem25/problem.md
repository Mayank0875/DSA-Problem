## Description

Given an n x n multiplication table, find the median element when all elements are sorted in increasing order. Note that n is guaranteed to be odd.

For example, for n = 3, the multiplication table is:
1 2 3
2 4 6
3 6 9
When sorted, the sequence is [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 6, 9]. The median (the fifth element) is 3.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

3

#### Output

3

#### Explanation

The sorted list is [1,2,2,3,3,4,6,6,9]. The median (5th element) is 3.

### 2

#### Input

5

#### Output

8

#### Explanation
The sorted list for n=5 has 25 elements. The median (13th element) is 8.

## Input Format

- A single integer n.

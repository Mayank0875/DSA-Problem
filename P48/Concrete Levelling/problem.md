## Title
Concrete Levelling

## Slug
concrete-levelling

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
A rough concrete floor has an uneven profile. A self-leveling compound is poured to fill in the dips. The compound fills voids relative to the surrounding high points. Given the height profile of the floor, calculate the total volume of compound needed to fill all the local dips.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
12
0 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 2 1

#### Output
6

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6.

### 2

#### Input
6
4 2 0 3 2 5

#### Output
9

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 9.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
- The second line contains n space-separated non-negative integers, representing the profile heights from left to right.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the total accumulated capacity.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 0 ≤ height ≤ 1e9

## Time Limit
2 second

## Memory Limit

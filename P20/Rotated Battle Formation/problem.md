## Description

A general arranges units in a line, sorted by their unique unit ID. To confuse the enemy, the general "rotates" the formation (e.g., [10, 20, 30, 40] becomes [30, 40, 10, 20]). You are given this rotated list of unique unit IDs and a target ID. Find the unit's index in the formation in O(log n) time. If the unit is not present, return -1.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

7 0 
[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]


#### Output

4

#### Explanation

The key numbered 0 is at position 4 on the spun key ring.

### 2

#### Input

7 3 
[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]

#### Output

-1

#### Explanation

The key numbered 3 is not on this key ring.

## Input Format

- The first line contains an integers n and target , the number of keys on the ring and the number of the key to find.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the key numbers after the ring was spun. All numbers are unique.

## Output Format

- Return the index (0-based position) of the target key if it exists else -1 if the target key is not found.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ key_number, target ≤ 10^9
- The array is a rotation of a sorted array.

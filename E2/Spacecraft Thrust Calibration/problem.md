## Description
A spaceship is preparing for an orbital insertion burn. The ship is equipped with numerous auxiliary thruster modules, each calibrated to a specific fuel flow rate. Due to the physics of the engine nozzles, the thrust generated by a module is equal to the square of its fuel flow rate. The onboard computer calculates that a specific total thrust is required to achieve the correct orbit. The pilot must select exactly three thrusters to fire simultaneously to hit that exact thrust target.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to choose three distinct thruster modules (at indices i < j < k) such that:

    rate_i^2 + rate_j^2 + rate_k^2 = total_thrust

If it is possible, print YES; otherwise, print NO.

## Examples

### 1
#### Input
5
1 2 2 3 4
9

#### Output
YES

#### Explanation
1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9.

### 2
#### Input
4
3 3 3 3
20

#### Output
NO

#### Explanation
Every square is 9; any sum of three squares is 27 which is not 20.

## Input Format
- First line: integer n — the number of thruster modules.
- Second line: n space-separated integers a1 a2 ... an — the fuel flow rates (can be negative, zero, or positive).
- Third line: integer target — the target sum.

## Output Format
- Return true (YES) if there exist indices i < j < k with a[i]^2 + a[j]^2 + a[k]^2 = target, otherwise return false (NO).

## Constraints
- 3 ≤ n ≤ 2000
- -10^6 ≤ ai ≤ 10^6
- 0 ≤ target ≤ 3×10^12

## Description

An observatory's star catalog lists stars sorted by their catalog number. A new star with `target` ID is discovered and must be added to the catalog.

Your task is to determine the index where this new star should be inserted.
The index should point to the first star in the catalog with an ID greater than or equal to `target`.
If all stars in the catalog have smaller IDs, the new star is placed at the end.


## Examples

### 1

#### Input

6 8
[2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12]


#### Output

3

#### Explanation

The first product with an ID greater than or equal to 8 is at index 3.

### 2

#### Input

6 6
[2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12]

#### Output

2

#### Explanation

No product has an ID equal to 6.
The first product with a larger ID (7) appears at index 2.

## Input Format

- The first line contains two integers n and target, where n = number of product IDs, and target = ID of the new product.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers — the sorted list of product IDs.

## Output Format

- Return a single integer — the index where the new product should be inserted.



## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ product_id, target ≤ 10^9
- The IDs are sorted in non-decreasing order.

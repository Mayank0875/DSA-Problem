## Description
A teleporter malfunction has materialized you correctly, but your name tag data stream arrived backward.

The data is stored as a string `s`. To fix your identity data, you must reverse the string.

Your challenge is to reverse the string `in-place`, meaning you must modify the given string (or character array) directly. You are not allowed to use extra space for another array. Your solution must use only `O(1)` (constant) extra memory.

## Examples

#### Output
olleh

#### Explanation
The input string `hello` is modified in-place to become `olleh`.

### 2

#### Input
level

#### Output

#### Explanation
The input string `level` is modified in-place to become `level`.

## Input Format

## Output Format

## Constraints

## Description
A university posts exam scores sorted from lowest to highest. A recruiter is looking for the first student who achieved a specific score to offer them a scholarship. Since multiple students may have the same score, finding the first one on the list is crucial. Return the index of the first student with the specific target score.
The data is sorted in non-decreasing order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
6 8
2 8 8 8 9 9

#### Output
1

#### Explanation
The target value 8 first appears at index 1.

2 5 7 8 11 12

#### Output
-1

#### Explanation
The target value 6 is not found in the list.

## Input Format
- The first line contains two integers n and target, the number of elements and the value to find.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the sorted sequence.

## Output Format

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ value, target ≤ 10^9
- The sequence is sorted in non-decreasing order.

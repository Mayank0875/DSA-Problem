## Description

A signal S is sent from a transmitter. It bounces off a surface and returns. The signal is "clean" if the original signal S was a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backward). Check if the original signal S was clean. Return 'Yes' if it was, and 'No' otherwise.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

level

#### Output

Yes

#### Explanation

The string "level" reads the same forwards and backward.
    
### 2

#### Input

adam

#### Output

No

#### Explanation

The string "adam" does not read the same forwards and backward ("mada").  

## Input Format  

- The input consists of a single line containing a string S.
- The string S contains only lowercase English letters (a - z).

## Output Format  

- Return 'Yes' if S is a palindrome, and 'No' otherwise.

## Description

A marine biologist is studying fish populations in an $n \times n$ grid of ocean zones (where $n$ is odd). The zones are indexed by $(i, j)$ where $1 \le i, j \le n$. The estimated fish population in zone $(i, j)$ is $i \times j$ due to currents and nutrient availability.To summarize the findings, the biologist needs to determine the median population size from all $n^2$ zones.

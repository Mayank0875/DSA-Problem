## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
A data center has a row of server racks of different heights. You need to install a rectangular cooling unit that attaches to the back of adjacent racks. The cooling unit must be rectangular and cannot extend above any rack it is attached to. Determine the maximum cooling surface area you can achieve.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
7
[6, 2, 5, 4, 5, 1, 6]

#### Output
12

#### Explanation
The largest rectangular area has a height of 4 and spans across elements with heights [5, 4, 5]. The width is 3 units (from index 2 to 4). Area = height * width = 4 * 3 = 12.

### 2

#### Input
4
[2, 1, 5, 6]

#### Output
10

#### Explanation
The largest rectangle has height 5 and spans elements with heights [5, 6]. Width = 2. Area = 5 * 2 = 10.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers, representing the heights/values of the elements from left to right.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the maximum possible rectangular area.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 1 ≤ height ≤ 1e9

## Time Limit
2 second

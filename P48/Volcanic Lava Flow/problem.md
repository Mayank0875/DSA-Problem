## Title
Volcanic Lava Flow

## Slug

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
Lava flows over a rocky terrain with ridges of varying heights. The lava fills the depressions between ridges before cooling. Geologists want to estimate the volume of the new rock formed in these depressions. Given the terrain profile, calculate the total trapped volume.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
12
0 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 2 1

#### Output
6

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6.

### 2

#### Input
6
4 2 0 3 2 5

#### Output
9

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 9.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
- The second line contains n space-separated non-negative integers, representing the profile heights from left to right.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the total accumulated capacity.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 0 ≤ height ≤ 1e9

## Time Limit
2 second

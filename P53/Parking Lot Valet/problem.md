## Difficulty

## Description
A long valet parking lane has cars (non-zero license hashes) and empty spots (`0`). To maximize efficiency, the valets move all cars to the entrance end of the lane (index 0), preserving their arrival order, so that all empty spots are grouped at the far end.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
5
0 1 0 3 12

#### Output
1 3 12 0 0

#### Explanation
The non-zero elements are 1, 3, and 12. They are moved to the front while maintaining their order, and the two 0s are pushed to the end.

### 2

#### Input
1
0

#### Output
0

#### Explanation
There is only one element, which is 0, so no changes are needed.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.

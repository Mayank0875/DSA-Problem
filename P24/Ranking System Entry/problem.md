## Description

A new player just completed a game and earned a `target` score. You are given the main ranking list, which is sorted in non-decreasing order. You need to find the new player's correct position in the ranking.

Your task is to determine the index where this new score should be inserted.
The index should point to the first score that is greater than or equal to the new player's score.
If all current players have lower scores, the new player is placed at the end.


## Examples

### 1

#### Input

6 8
[2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12]


#### Output

3

#### Explanation

The first product with an ID greater than or equal to 8 is at index 3.

### 2

#### Input

6 6
[2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12]

#### Output

2

#### Explanation

No product has an ID equal to 6.
The first product with a larger ID (7) appears at index 2.

## Input Format

- The first line contains two integers n and target, where n = number of product IDs, and target = ID of the new product.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers — the sorted list of product IDs.

## Output Format

- Return a single integer — the index where the new product should be inserted.



## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ product_id, target ≤ 10^9
- The IDs are sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Description

An architect is designing a bridge. The sequence of support cable types is represented by a string S. The design is "symmetrical" if the string S is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards as it does backward. Is the architect's design symmetrical? Return 'Yes' or 'No'.

## Examples

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
Rows of solar panels are installed at different heights on a hill. Shadows (or water/debris) accumulate in the troughs between the rows. To plan for cleaning, you need to calculate the capacity of these troughs. Given the heights of the panel rows, determine the total volume that can be trapped between them.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
12
0 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 2 1

#### Output
6

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6.

### 2

#### Input
6
4 2 0 3 2 5

#### Output
9

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 9.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
- The second line contains n space-separated non-negative integers, representing the profile heights from left to right.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the total accumulated capacity.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 0 ≤ height ≤ 1e9

## Time Limit

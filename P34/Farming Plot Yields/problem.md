## Description

A square farm is divided into an $n \times n$ grid of identical plots. The plots are indexed by their row $i$ and column $j$ (from 1 to $n$). Due to varying soil quality, the plot at $(i, j)$ yields exactly $i \times j$ bushels of corn.A statistician wants to find the median yield value among all $n^2$ plots to determine the farm's overall performance. Given that $n$ is an odd number, what is the median yield?

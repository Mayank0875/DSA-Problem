## Title
Histogram Ink Spill

## Slug
histogram-ink-spill

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
You have a histogram printed on a page where the bars have different heights. You accidentally spill ink over the top. The ink settles into the valleys between the bars. Calculate the total area of ink trapped within the histogram's profile given the bar heights.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
12
0 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 2 1

#### Output
6

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6.

### 2

#### Input
6
4 2 0 3 2 5

#### Output
9

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 9.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
- The second line contains n space-separated non-negative integers, representing the profile heights from left to right.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the total accumulated capacity.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 0 ≤ height ≤ 1e9

## Time Limit
2 second

## Memory Limit

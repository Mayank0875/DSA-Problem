## Description
Metallurgists test an alloy composed of different metal layers.

The alloy layers is represented as an array `a` of length `n`, consisting of non-negative integers.

To analyze this, we define the "structural bond" of a segment from index `l` to `r` as the bitwise XOR sum of all elements in that segment:
$$f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l+1} \oplus \dots \oplus a_r$$

However, the durability is proportional to the thickness of the alloy. The "durability rating" of a segment is the product of its structural bond `f(l, r)` and its length `(r - l + 1)`.

Your task is to calculate the sum of the durability rating for all possible subsegments `[l, r]` of the array.
Formally, compute:
$$ \sum_{l=1}^{n} \sum_{r=l}^{n} (f(l, r) \times (r - l + 1)) $$

Since the result can be very large, print it modulo 998244353.

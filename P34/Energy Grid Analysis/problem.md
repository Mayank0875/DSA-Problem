## Description

Scientists are analyzing an $n \times n$ energy grid, where $n$ is an odd integer. The grid cells are indexed by $(i, j)$ from 1 to $n$. The energy level measured at cell $(i, j)$ is exactly $i \times j$ units.To report their findings, they must calculate the median energy level of all $n^2$ cells.

## Examples

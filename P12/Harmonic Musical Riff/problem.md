## Description

A composer writes a short musical riff S (represented as a string of notes). The riff is considered "harmonically balanced" if it is a palindrome, meaning the sequence of notes is the same forwards and backward. Is the composer's riff harmonically balanced? Return 'Yes' or 'No'.

## Examples

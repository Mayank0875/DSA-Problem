## Description

An ant forages for food on a `board` (grid), leaving a pheromone trail. Each grid cell has a letter. Scientists want to know if an ant can leave a trail that spells a specific `word`. The ant moves up, down, left, or right to adjacent cells, and never crosses its own path (no cell reuse).

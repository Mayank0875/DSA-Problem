## Title
Forest Canopy Mist

## Slug
forest-canopy-mist

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
A dense forest has trees of varying heights. Morning mist settles in the gaps between the tree canopies. Scientists modeling the microclimate need to calculate the volume of this mist layer. Given the tree heights along a transect, find the total trapped mist volume.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
12
0 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 2 1

#### Output
6

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6.

### 2

#### Input
6
4 2 0 3 2 5

#### Output
9

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 9.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
- The second line contains n space-separated non-negative integers, representing the profile heights from left to right.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the total accumulated capacity.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 0 ≤ height ≤ 1e9

## Time Limit
2 second

## Title

Temporal Code: Previous Lower Timestamp

## Slug

temporal-code-previous-lower

## Difficulty

Easy

## Description

You are working with a sequence of timestamps generated by a temporal code system. For each timestamp, you need to find the value of the nearest earlier timestamp that is strictly smaller than the current one. If no such earlier timestamp exists (either because it is the first entry or all previous timestamps are greater than or equal to it), you should indicate this with `-1`. This information helps identify the most recent point in time where the code value dropped. Compute this value for every timestamp in the given sequence.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

8
[100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85, 110]

#### Output

[-1, -1, -1, 60, -1, 60, 75, 85]

#### Explanation

Day 0 (100): No previous timestamp, output -1.
Day 1 (80): Timestamp 100 on day 0 is not lower, output -1.
Day 2 (60): Timestamps 100, 80 are not lower, output -1.
Day 3 (70): Timestamp 60 on day 2 is lower, output 60.
Day 4 (60): Timestamps 100, 80, 60, 70. None are strictly lower, output -1.
Day 5 (75): Timestamp 60 on day 4 is the nearest lower, output 60.
Day 6 (85): Timestamp 75 on day 5 is the nearest lower, output 75.
Day 7 (110): Timestamp 85 on day 6 is the nearest lower, output 85.

### 2

#### Input

5
50 50 50 50 50

#### Output

[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

#### Explanation

All timestamps are equal, so no strictly lower previous timestamp exists for any entry.

## Input Format

The first line contains a single integer n, the number of timestamps.
The second line contains n space-separated integers p_0, p_1, ..., p_[n-1], representing the temporal code values for each timestamp.

## Output Format

Return array of integers. The i-th integer should be the temporal code value on the nearest day j < i such that p_j < p_i. If no such day exists, then -1.

## Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ p_i ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.

## Time Limit

2 second

## Memory Limit

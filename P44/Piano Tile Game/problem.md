## Description
In a rhythm game, 'notes' fall as vertical bars of different lengths. You get bonus points for highlighting the largest rectangular area covered by adjacent notes. Given the lengths of the notes currently on screen, calculate the maximum score (area) you can achieve.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
7
[6, 2, 5, 4, 5, 1, 6]

#### Output
12

#### Explanation
The largest rectangular area has a height of 4 and spans across elements with heights [5, 4, 5]. The width is 3 units (from index 2 to 4). Area = height * width = 4 * 3 = 12.

### 2

#### Input
4
[2, 1, 5, 6]

#### Output
10

#### Explanation
The largest rectangle has height 5 and spans elements with heights [5, 6]. Width = 2. Area = 5 * 2 = 10.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers, representing the heights/values of the elements from left to right.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the maximum possible rectangular area.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 1 ≤ height ≤ 1e9

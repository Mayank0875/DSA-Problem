## Description
You are installing a rectangular array of solar panels on a roof with a stepped, uneven profile. The roof is divided into segments of equal width but varying structural heights. To ensure stability, the solar array must be rectangular and mounted flat against the vertical profile defined by these segments. Find the largest rectangular area of solar panels that can be fitted.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
7
[6, 2, 5, 4, 5, 1, 6]

#### Output
12

#### Explanation
The largest rectangular area has a height of 4 and spans across elements with heights [5, 4, 5]. The width is 3 units (from index 2 to 4). Area = height * width = 4 * 3 = 12.

### 2

#### Input
4
[2, 1, 5, 6]

#### Output
10

#### Explanation
The largest rectangle has height 5 and spans elements with heights [5, 6]. Width = 2. Area = 5 * 2 = 10.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers, representing the heights/values of the elements from left to right.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the maximum possible rectangular area.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 1 ≤ height ≤ 1e9

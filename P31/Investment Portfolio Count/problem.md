## Description

An investor has $N$ available stock shares to purchase, with prices $candidates_i$. This list of available shares may include multiple shares from the same company (duplicates). The investor wants to build a portfolio with a total cost of exactly $T$. Your task is to find the *total count* of unique combinations of these shares that sum to $T$. Each share from the list may be purchased *only once*.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

7 8 
[10, 1, 2, 7, 6, 1, 5]

#### Output

4

#### Explanation

The 4 unique combinations are [1, 1, 6], [1, 2, 5], [1, 7], and [2, 6].    

### 2

#### Input

5 5 
[2, 5, 2, 1, 2]

#### Output

2

#### Explanation
The 2 unique combinations are [1, 2, 2] and [5].

## Input Format  

- The first line contains two integers, $N$ and $T$, representing the number of candidate numbers and the target sum.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers, $candidates_i$.

## Output Format  

- Return single integer representing the total number of unique combinations that sum to the target.
  

## Constraints  

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ candidates[i] ≤ 50
- 1 ≤ target ≤ 30

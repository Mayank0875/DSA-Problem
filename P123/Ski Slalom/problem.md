## Title
Ski Slalom

## Slug

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
A skier passes flags. They can turn tight (1 flag) or wide (2 flags). Wide turns lose speed, so two in a row are avoided.

The skier starts at flag 0 and wants to reach flag $n$.

On each move, The skier can ski forward either **1 flag** (+1) or **2 flags** (+2). However, momentum is lost. Therefore, The skier **cannot perform two consecutive +2 wide turns**.

Your task is to calculate the number of distinct valid ways The skier can reach flag $n$. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
3

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
The valid paths to reach flag 3 are:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 (+1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 3 (+1, +2)
3. 0 -> 2 -> 3 (+2, +1)

Note: The path starting with +2 is valid as long as the next jump is not +2.

### 2

#### Input
4

#### Output
4

#### Explanation
Valid paths:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 (+1, +1, +2)
3. 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +2, +1)
4. 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+2, +1, +1)

Invalid path:
0 -> 2 -> 4 (+2, +2) is not allowed.

## Input Format
- The only input line has an integer $n$ — the target flag index.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer: the number of ways modulo $10^9 + 7$.

## Description
In a card game, a player's hand is an array where cards have values and used cards become `0`. The player organizes their hand by sliding all remaining cards to the left, keeping their order, and pushing the empty slots (`0`) to the right side of their hand.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
5
0 1 0 3 12

#### Output
1 3 12 0 0

#### Explanation
The non-zero elements are 1, 3, and 12. They are moved to the front while maintaining their order, and the two 0s are pushed to the end.

### 2

#### Input
1
0

#### Output
0

#### Explanation
There is only one element, which is 0, so no changes are needed.

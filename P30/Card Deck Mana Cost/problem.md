## Description

In a trading card game, you are building a deck. You want the total "mana cost" of your deck to be exactly $T$. You can choose from a list of cards with different mana costs (e.g., 2, 3, 5). You can include an unlimited number of copies of each card. How many *total unique combinations* of cards can you choose to sum to $T$?

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

4 7 
[2, 3, 6, 7]

#### Output

2

#### Explanation

The two unique combinations are [2, 2, 3] and [7].

### 2

#### Input

3 8 
[2, 3, 5]

#### Output

3

#### Explanation

The three unique combinations are [2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 3, 3], and [3, 5].

## Input Format  

- The first line contains two integers, $N$ and $T$, representing the number of coin denominations and the target sum
- The second line contains $N$ distinct space-separated integers, $candidates_i$, representing the coin denominations.

## Output Format  

- Return single integer representing the total number of unique combinations that sum to the target.
  

## Constraints  

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 30
- 1 ≤ candidates[i] ≤ 40
- 1 ≤ target ≤ 40
- All elements of candidates are distinct.

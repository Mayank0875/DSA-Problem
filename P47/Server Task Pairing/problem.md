## Difficulty
Easy

## Description
A cloud computing load balancer assigns tasks to processing cores. Each core can handle at most two tasks simultaneously, provided their combined resource load does not exceed the core's limit. Given the load requirements of pending tasks, determine the minimum number of cores needed.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
4 10
7 2 3 9

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
We can group the items as follows:
1. (2, 7) -> sum is 9 <= 10.
2. (3) -> sum is 3 <= 10.
3. (9) -> sum is 9 <= 10.
Total groups = 3.

### 2

#### Input
5 5
2 2 2 3 4

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
We can group the items as follows:
1. (2, 3) -> sum is 5 <= 5.
2. (2, 2) -> sum is 4 <= 5.
3. (4) -> sum is 4 <= 5.
Total groups = 3.

## Input Format
- The first line contains two integers n and x: the number of items and the maximum limit per group.
- The second line contains n integers representing the values/weights of the items.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer: the minimum number of groups required.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 1 ≤ x ≤ 1e9
- 1 ≤ values[i] ≤ x

## Time Limit
2 second

## Memory Limit
256 MB

## Title
Kangaroo Jump

## Slug
kangaroo-jump

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
A kangaroo travels the bush. It can hop (1 m) or bound (2 m). Bounding is tiring, preventing consecutive bounds.

The kangaroo starts at meter 0 and wants to reach meter $n$.

On each move, The kangaroo can jump forward either **1 m** (+1) or **2 m** (+2). However, energy reserves are low. Therefore, The kangaroo **cannot perform two consecutive +2 bounds**.

Your task is to calculate the number of distinct valid ways The kangaroo can reach meter $n$. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
3

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
The valid paths to reach meter 3 are:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 (+1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 3 (+1, +2)
3. 0 -> 2 -> 3 (+2, +1)

Note: The path starting with +2 is valid as long as the next jump is not +2.

### 2

#### Input
4

#### Output
4

#### Explanation
Valid paths:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 (+1, +1, +2)
3. 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +2, +1)
4. 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+2, +1, +1)

Invalid path:
0 -> 2 -> 4 (+2, +2) is not allowed.

## Input Format

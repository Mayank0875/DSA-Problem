## Title
Stadium Seat Cleaning

## Slug
stadium-seat-cleaning

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
The rows of a stadium are built at varying heights (perhaps due to a unique design or settling). Rainwater pools on the stands in the dips between higher rows. The cleaning crew needs to pump this water out. Calculate the total volume of water trapped on the stands given the row heights.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
12
0 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 2 1

#### Output
6

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6.

### 2

#### Input
6
4 2 0 3 2 5

#### Output
9

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 9.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
- The second line contains n space-separated non-negative integers, representing the profile heights from left to right.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the total accumulated capacity.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 0 ≤ height ≤ 1e9

## Time Limit
2 second

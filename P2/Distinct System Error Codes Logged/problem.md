## Description

A system administrator is reviewing error logs generated by a complex software system. Each type of error is assigned a unique numerical code. The log file contains a sequence of error codes recorded over time, and the same error code might appear multiple times. To understand the variety of issues encountered, the administrator needs to count how many distinct error codes were logged. Given the list of error codes, find the number of unique error types.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

5
[2, 3, 2, 2, 3]

#### Output

2

#### Explanation

The error codes logged are 2, 3, 2, 2, 3. The unique codes are 2 and 3. There were 2 distinct types of errors.

### 2

#### Input

8
[10, 5, 10, 2, 5, 10, 5, 2]

#### Output

3

#### Explanation

The unique codes are 10, 5, and 2. There were 3 distinct types of errors.

## Input Format

- The first line contains an integer n: the total number of error entries logged.
- The second line contains $n$ integers x_1, x_2, ...., x_n: the error codes.

## Output Format

- Return a single integer: the count of distinct error codes.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 1e9

## Time Limit

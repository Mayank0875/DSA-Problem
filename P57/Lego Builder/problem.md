## Description
A child has a box of Lego bricks of different colors (represented by characters). They have an instruction booklet with various models. A model can be built if the box contains all the necessary bricks. Calculate the total size (number of bricks) of all the models that can be built individually.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
4
cat bt hat tree
atach

#### Output
6

#### Explanation
The items that can be formed are "cat" and "hat".
"cat" requires 'c', 'a', 't'. The supply "atach" has all of these.
"hat" requires 'h', 'a', 't'. The supply "atach" has all of these.
"bt" requires 'b', which is missing.
"tree" requires 'r' and 'e', which are missing.
Total value = length("cat") + length("hat") = 3 + 3 = 6.

### 2

#### Input
3
hello world code
welldonehoneyr

#### Output
10

#### Explanation
We can form "hello" and "world".
Total value = 5 + 5 = 10.

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
A cross-section of a rice terrace farm shows earth walls of different heights. Water is retained in the paddies formed between these walls. To manage irrigation, you need to calculate the total water retention capacity of the terrace system given the heights of the earth walls.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
12
0 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 2 1

#### Output
6

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6.

### 2

#### Input
6
4 2 0 3 2 5

#### Output
9

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 9.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
- The second line contains n space-separated non-negative integers, representing the profile heights from left to right.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the total accumulated capacity.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 0 ≤ height ≤ 1e9

## Time Limit
2 second

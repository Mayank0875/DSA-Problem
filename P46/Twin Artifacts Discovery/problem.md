## Description
An archaeologist is cataloging pottery shards found at a dig site. Each shard has a unique pattern ID. To reconstruct a specific type of ancient vase, she needs shards that appear as exact pairs (exactly two matching pieces). Given the list of pattern IDs found, identify which patterns have exactly two fragments so they can be assembled. Return the IDs in increasing order.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
8
1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4

#### Output
2 4

#### Explanation
Value 2 appears twice. Value 4 appears twice. Value 3 appears three times (ignored). Value 1 appears once (ignored). The result is 2 and 4, sorted.

### 2

#### Input
5
5 5 5 6 7

#### Output


#### Explanation
Value 5 appears three times. Values 6 and 7 appear once. No value appears exactly twice.

## Input Format

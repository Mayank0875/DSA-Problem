## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
A player moves down court. They can take a step (1 unit) or a long stride (2 units). Two long strides look like a travel foul, so they are avoided.

The player starts at line 0 and wants to reach line $n$.

On each move, The player can move forward either **1 unit** (+1) or **2 units** (+2). However, referees might call a foul. Therefore, The player **cannot perform two consecutive +2 strides**.

Your task is to calculate the number of distinct valid ways The player can reach line $n$. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
3

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
The valid paths to reach line 3 are:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 (+1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 3 (+1, +2)
3. 0 -> 2 -> 3 (+2, +1)

Note: The path starting with +2 is valid as long as the next jump is not +2.

### 2

#### Input
4

#### Output
4

#### Explanation
Valid paths:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 (+1, +1, +2)
3. 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +2, +1)
4. 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+2, +1, +1)

Invalid path:
0 -> 2 -> 4 (+2, +2) is not allowed.

## Input Format
- The only input line has an integer $n$ — the target unit index.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer: the number of ways modulo $10^9 + 7$.

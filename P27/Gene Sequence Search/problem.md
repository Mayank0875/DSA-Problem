## Description

A biologist is studying a 2D sample of genetic material, represented as a `board` (grid) of base pairs (letters). They need to know if a specific `word` (gene sequence) is present. The sequence can be formed by starting at any cell and moving to adjacent cells (up, down, left, or right). The same cell cannot be part of the sequence more than once.
## Examples

### 1

#### Input

[["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]]
"SEE"

#### Output

Yes

#### Explanation

Word Exist's in Grid.
 
### 2

#### Input

[["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]]
"ABCB"

#### Output

No

#### Explanation

Word didn't Exist's in Grid.

## Input Format 

- The first line contains two integers, `m` and `n`, representing the number of rows and columns in the grid.
- The next `m` lines each contain `n` uppercase English letters, representing the `board`.
- The last line contains the `word` to search for.

## Output Format 

- Return `true` if the word exists in the grid. Otherwise `false`.
 

## Constraints 

- 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 5
- 1 ≤ word.length ≤ 5
- `board` and `word` consist of only uppercase English letters.

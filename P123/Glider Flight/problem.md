## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
A glider pilot navigates thermals. They can glide 1 mile or dive 2 miles. Diving loses too much altitude to do twice in a row safely.

The pilot starts at mile 0 and wants to reach mile $n$.

On each move, The pilot can fly forward either **1 mile** (+1) or **2 miles** (+2). However, altitude gets too low. Therefore, The pilot **cannot perform two consecutive +2 dives**.

Your task is to calculate the number of distinct valid ways The pilot can reach mile $n$. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
3

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
The valid paths to reach mile 3 are:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 (+1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 3 (+1, +2)
3. 0 -> 2 -> 3 (+2, +1)

Note: The path starting with +2 is valid as long as the next jump is not +2.

### 2

#### Input
4

#### Output
4

#### Explanation
Valid paths:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 (+1, +1, +2)
3. 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +2, +1)
4. 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+2, +1, +1)

Invalid path:
0 -> 2 -> 4 (+2, +2) is not allowed.

## Input Format
- The only input line has an integer $n$ — the target mile index.

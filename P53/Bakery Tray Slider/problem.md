## Description
Fresh buns (non-zero IDs) are on a tray, but some have been sold, leaving crumbs (`0`). The baker slides all the remaining buns to the front of the display case so it looks full, leaving the empty space at the back.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
5
0 1 0 3 12

#### Output
1 3 12 0 0

#### Explanation
The non-zero elements are 1, 3, and 12. They are moved to the front while maintaining their order, and the two 0s are pushed to the end.

### 2

#### Input
1
0

#### Output
0

#### Explanation
There is only one element, which is 0, so no changes are needed.

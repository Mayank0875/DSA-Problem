## Description
A trader buys stocks. They can buy a small lot (1 unit) or a large block (2 units). Buying large blocks raises market suspicion, so it can't be done consecutively.

The trader starts at volume 0 and wants to reach volume $n$.

On each move, The trader can buy forward either **1 unit** (+1) or **2 units** (+2). However, regulators are watching. Therefore, The trader **cannot perform two consecutive +2 large buys**.

Your task is to calculate the number of distinct valid ways The trader can reach volume $n$. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
3

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
The valid paths to reach volume 3 are:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 (+1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 3 (+1, +2)
3. 0 -> 2 -> 3 (+2, +1)

Note: The path starting with +2 is valid as long as the next jump is not +2.

### 2

#### Input
4

#### Output
4

#### Explanation
Valid paths:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 (+1, +1, +2)
3. 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +2, +1)
4. 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+2, +1, +1)

Invalid path:
0 -> 2 -> 4 (+2, +2) is not allowed.

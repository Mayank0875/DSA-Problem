## Description

In an acoustic lab, $n$ sound emitters and $n$ receivers are set up in a line. Both are numbered 1 to $n$. The "interference pattern" measured at receiver $j$ from emitter $i$ has an intensity of $i \times j$.A physicist is analyzing the $n^2$ possible intensity values and needs to find the median value. Given that $n$ is an odd number, what is the median?

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

3

#### Output

3

#### Explanation

The numbers in increasing order are [1,2,2,3,3,4,6,6,9], so the answer is 3. 
    
### 2

#### Input

5

#### Output

8

#### Explanation
The middle element is 8.

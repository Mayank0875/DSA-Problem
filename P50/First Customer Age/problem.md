## Description
A marketing team has a list of customer ages sorted in ascending order. They want to target the first customer in the database who is exactly a certain age. Given the sorted ages, find the index of the first occurrence of the target age.
The data is sorted in non-decreasing order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
6 8
2 8 8 8 9 9

#### Output
1

#### Explanation
The target value 8 first appears at index 1.

### 2

#### Input
6 6
2 5 7 8 11 12

#### Output
-1

#### Explanation
The target value 6 is not found in the list.

## Input Format
- The first line contains two integers n and target, the number of elements and the value to find.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the sorted sequence.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer: the index of the first occurrence of the target, or -1 if it is not found.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ value, target ≤ 10^9
- The sequence is sorted in non-decreasing order.

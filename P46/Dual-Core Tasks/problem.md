Dual-Core Tasks

## Slug
dual-core-tasks

## Difficulty
Easy

## Description
A CPU scheduler logs task IDs. Tasks designed for dual-core processing are dispatched exactly twice (once per core). Single-threaded tasks appear once; parallel tasks appear more. The OS needs to identify which task IDs are running in dual-core mode. Return these IDs.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
8
1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4

#### Output
2 4

#### Explanation
Value 2 appears twice. Value 4 appears twice. Value 3 appears three times (ignored). Value 1 appears once (ignored). The result is 2 and 4, sorted.

### 2

#### Input
5
5 5 5 6 7

#### Output


#### Explanation
Value 5 appears three times. Values 6 and 7 appear once. No value appears exactly twice.

## Input Format
- First line: integer n — number of elements.
- Second line: n space-separated integers.

## Output Format
- Return all integers that appear exactly twice in increasing order, as a list/array. If none, return an empty list/array.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- Values fit in 32-bit signed integer

## Time Limit
1 second

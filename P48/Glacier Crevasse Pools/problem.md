## Title
Glacier Crevasse Pools

## Slug
glacier-crevasse-pools

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
A glacier's surface is uneven, with ice ridges of varying heights. Meltwater pools in the crevasses (dips) between these ridges. Scientists want to estimate the surface water volume. Given the elevation profile of the ice, calculate the total water trapped in the pools.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
12
0 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 2 1

#### Output
6

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6.

### 2

#### Input
6
4 2 0 3 2 5

#### Output
9

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 9.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
- The second line contains n space-separated non-negative integers, representing the profile heights from left to right.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the total accumulated capacity.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 0 ≤ height ≤ 1e9

## Time Limit
2 second

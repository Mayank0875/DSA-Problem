## Title
Fishing Catch Size

## Slug
fishing-catch-size

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
A fisherman records the weight of the total catch for every trip. For each trip, they calculate a 'catch streak', defined as the number of consecutive previous trips (including the current one) where the catch weight was less than or equal to the current trip. Given the catch logs, calculate this streak.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
7
100 80 60 70 60 75 85

#### Output
1 1 1 2 1 4 6

#### Explanation
Index 0 (100): Streak is 1.
Index 1 (80): Streak is 1.
Index 2 (60): Streak is 1.
Index 3 (70): 60 <= 70. Streak is 2.
Index 4 (60): Streak is 1.
Index 5 (75): 60, 70, 60 <= 75. Streak is 4.
Index 6 (85): 80, 60, 70, 60, 75 <= 85. Streak is 6.

### 2

#### Input
5
10 20 30 40 50

#### Output
1 2 3 4 5

#### Explanation
Each value is greater than all previous values, so the streak increments by 1 each step.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of entries.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers, representing the data sequence.

## Output Format
- Return an n-sized array, where the i-th integer is the streak for index i.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 1 ≤ value ≤ 1e9

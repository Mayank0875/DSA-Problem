## Description
An artist folds paper. They can make a simple crease (1 fold) or a complex pleat (2 folds). Pleats stress the paper, so two in a row would tear it.

The artist starts at step 0 and wants to reach step $n$.

On each move, The artist can fold forward either **1 step** (+1) or **2 steps** (+2). However, the paper weakens. Therefore, The artist **cannot perform two consecutive +2 pleats**.

Your task is to calculate the number of distinct valid ways The artist can reach step $n$. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
3

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
The valid paths to reach step 3 are:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 (+1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 3 (+1, +2)
3. 0 -> 2 -> 3 (+2, +1)

Note: The path starting with +2 is valid as long as the next jump is not +2.

### 2

#### Input
4

#### Output
4

#### Explanation
Valid paths:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 (+1, +1, +2)
3. 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +2, +1)
4. 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+2, +1, +1)

Invalid path:
0 -> 2 -> 4 (+2, +2) is not allowed.

## Input Format

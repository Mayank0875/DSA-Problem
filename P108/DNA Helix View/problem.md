## Description
A 3D model of DNA rotates on screen. The base pairs visible in the front change as the model spins.

The model view is represented by an array. Rotating the model rotates the base pairs $k$ positions to the right. A rotation to the right means the last base pair moves to the first position, and all other base pairs shift one spot to the right. This process happens $k$ times.

Your task is to determine the final arrangement of the base pairs in the model view. You must achieve this efficiently, ideally modifying the structure in-place.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
7 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

#### Output
5 6 7 1 2 3 4

#### Explanation
Initial: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
Rotate 1: `[7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
Rotate 2: `[6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
Rotate 3: `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

### 2

#### Input
4 2
-1 -100 3 99

#### Output
3 99 -1 -100

#### Explanation
Rotate 1: `[99, -1, -100, 3]`
Rotate 2: `[3, 99, -1, -100]`

## Input Format
- The first line contains two integers, $n$ and $k$, the number of base pairs and the rotation count.
- The second line contains $n$ space-separated integers representing the base pairs.

## Output Format
- Return the array containing the $n$ integers in their new order, separated by spaces.

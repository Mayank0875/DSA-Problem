## Description

A developer is recovering a fragmented program. The fragments are in a `board` (grid) of characters. They need to find if a specific function name (`word`) can be pieced together. The `word` is formed by moving from one fragment to an adjacent one (up, down, left, or right), without reusing any fragment (cell).

- The last line contains the `word` to search for.

## Output Format 

- Return `true` if the word exists in the grid. Otherwise `false`.
 

## Constraints 

- 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 5

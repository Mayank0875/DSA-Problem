## Description
A digital measuring cup has graduations marked at specific volumes, sorted in order. A recipe calls for a precise amount of liquid. To help the cook, the cup's display needs to highlight the first graduation mark that is equal to or exceeds the required volume.
The data is sorted in non-decreasing order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
6 8
2 5 7 8 11 12

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
The first element greater than or equal to 8 is 8, which is at index 3.

### 2

#### Input
6 6
2 5 7 8 11 12

#### Output
2

#### Explanation
There is no element 6. The first element greater than 6 is 7, which is at index 2.

## Input Format
- The first line contains two integers n and target, the number of elements and the value to search/insert.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the sorted sequence.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the index (0-based) of the first element that is greater than or equal to the target. If all elements are smaller, return n.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ value, target ≤ 10^9
- The sequence is sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Time Limit

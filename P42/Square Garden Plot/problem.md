## Description
A landscape architect has a shipment of flower seeds, each sufficient for one square foot of land. The client has requested the largest possible perfect square garden bed. Given the total number of seed packets available, you must calculate the maximum side length (in feet) of the square garden that can be fully planted.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
10

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
3² = 9 ≤ 10, 4² = 16 > 10

### 2

#### Input
25

#### Output
5

#### Explanation
5² = 25 ≤ 25, 6² = 36 > 25

## Input Format
- A single integer x — the total number of seed packets available.

## Output Format
- Return single integer — the maximum possible side length r of the square garden that can be built using those seed packets.

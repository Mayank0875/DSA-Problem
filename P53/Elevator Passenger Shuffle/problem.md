## Title
Elevator Passenger Shuffle

## Slug
elevator-passenger-shuffle

## Difficulty
Easy

## Description
People (weights) are standing in a line in a large elevator. Gaps (`0`) exist between them. To make room for more people at the back, everyone currently inside shuffles forward to fill the gaps, leaving the empty space at the rear.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
5
0 1 0 3 12

#### Output
1 3 12 0 0

#### Explanation
The non-zero elements are 1, 3, and 12. They are moved to the front while maintaining their order, and the two 0s are pushed to the end.

### 2

#### Input
1
0

#### Output
0

#### Explanation
There is only one element, which is 0, so no changes are needed.

## Input Format

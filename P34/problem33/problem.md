## Description

Given an n x n multiplication table (with n odd), find the median value when all the entries are sorted in increasing order. 

For example, for n = 3, the multiplication table is:
    [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6], [3, 6, 9]]
The sorted list is [1,2,2,3,3,4,6,6,9], so the median (the 5th element) is 3.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

3

#### Output

3

#### Explanation

The sorted list is [1,2,2,3,3,4,6,6,9]. The median (the 5th element) is 3.

### 2

#### Input

5

#### Output

8

#### Explanation
The sorted list of 25 numbers has 8 as the 13th element (the median).

## Input Format

- The only input line has an integer n.

## Output Format

- Return the median value.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e6

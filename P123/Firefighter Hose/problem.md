## Description
A firefighter sprays water. They can burst (1 sec) or stream (2 sec). Streaming drops tank pressure, preventing consecutive streams.

The firefighter starts at sec 0 and wants to reach sec $n$.

On each move, The firefighter can spray forward either **1 sec** (+1) or **2 secs** (+2). However, pressure must build. Therefore, The firefighter **cannot perform two consecutive +2 streams**.

Your task is to calculate the number of distinct valid ways The firefighter can reach sec $n$. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
3

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
The valid paths to reach sec 3 are:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 (+1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 3 (+1, +2)
3. 0 -> 2 -> 3 (+2, +1)

Note: The path starting with +2 is valid as long as the next jump is not +2.

### 2

#### Input
4

#### Output
4

#### Explanation
Valid paths:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 (+1, +1, +2)
3. 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +2, +1)
4. 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+2, +1, +1)

Invalid path:
0 -> 2 -> 4 (+2, +2) is not allowed.

## Input Format
- The only input line has an integer $n$ — the target sec index.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer: the number of ways modulo $10^9 + 7$.

## Description
A train station logs the arrival times of trains in chronological order. A passenger wants to catch a train arriving exactly at a specific time. Because multiple trains might arrive at the same minute, they want to find the index of the very first train that arrived at that target time. Given the sorted list of arrival times, return the index of the first occurrence of the target time, or -1 if no train arrived at that time.
The data is sorted in non-decreasing order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
6 8
2 8 8 8 9 9

#### Output
1

#### Explanation
The target value 8 first appears at index 1.

### 2

#### Input
6 6
2 5 7 8 11 12

#### Output
-1

#### Explanation
The target value 6 is not found in the list.

## Input Format
- The first line contains two integers n and target, the number of elements and the value to find.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the sorted sequence.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer: the index of the first occurrence of the target, or -1 if it is not found.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ value, target ≤ 10^9
- The sequence is sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Time Limit

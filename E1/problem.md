## Description

You are given an array nums representing loads distributed across stations in a line. A balance pivot is an index where the sum of all loads strictly to its left is equal to the sum of all loads strictly to its right. If the pivot lies at an edge, the missing side is treated as having a sum of 0. Your task is to return the leftmost such balance pivot. If no balance point exists, return -1.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

nums = [1, 7, 3, 6, 5, 6]

#### Output

3

#### Explanation

For index 3 (value = 6):
Left side sum = 1 + 7 + 3 = 11
Right side sum = 5 + 6 = 11
Both sides are equal, so index 3 is a balance pivot.
It is also the leftmost such index.


### 2

#### Input

nums = [1, 2, 3]

#### Output

-1

#### Explanation

Index 0: left sum = 0, right sum = 2 + 3 = 5 (not equal)
Index 1: left sum = 1, right sum = 3 (not equal)
Index 2: left sum = 1 + 2 = 3, right sum = 0 (not equal)
No index has equal left and right sum, so answer is -1.


### 3

#### Input

nums = [2, 1, -1]

#### Output

0

#### Explanation

At index 0:
Left sum = 0
Right sum = 1 + (-1) = 0
Both sides are equal, so index 0 is a balance pivot.
Since it is the first index, it is the leftmost pivot.


## Input Format

- A single line containing an integer array `nums`.

## Output Format

- Return the index representing the leftmost pivot, or -1 if no such pivot exists.

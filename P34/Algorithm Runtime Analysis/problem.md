## Description

A computer scientist is testing $n$ different algorithms (ranked 1 to $n$) on $n$ different data sets (ranked 1 to $n$). The runtime of algorithm $i$ on data set $j$ is measured to be $i \times j$ milliseconds.To publish the results, the scientist needs to report the median runtime from all $n^2$ tests. Given that $n$ is an odd number, find this median.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

3

#### Output

3

#### Explanation

The numbers in increasing order are [1,2,2,3,3,4,6,6,9], so the answer is 3. 
    
### 2

#### Input

5

#### Output

8

#### Explanation
The middle element is 8.

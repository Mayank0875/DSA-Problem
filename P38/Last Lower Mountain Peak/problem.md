Last Lower Mountain Peak

## Difficulty
Easy

## Description
You are a geographer analyzing the elevation profile of a mountain range. You have a sequence of peak heights measured from west to east. For topographical prominence analysis, you need to identify the height of the nearest peak to the west (previous) that is strictly lower than the current peak. This helps in understanding the terrain's ruggedness and local elevation changes. For each peak height in the sequence, your goal is to find the height of the closest preceding peak that is strictly smaller. If all peaks to the west are higher or equal, or if it is the first peak, you must indicate that no such peak exists. Your task is to calculate this for every peak in the range.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
8
[100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85, 110]

#### Output
[-1, -1, -1, 60, -1, 60, 75, 85]

#### Explanation
Index 0 (100): No previous value, output -1.
Index 1 (80): 100 is not lower, output -1.
Index 2 (60): 100, 80 are not lower, output -1.
Index 3 (70): 60 is the nearest lower value, output 60.
Index 4 (60): No strictly lower previous value, output -1.
Index 5 (75): 60 at index 4 is nearest lower, output 60.
Index 6 (85): 75 at index 5 is nearest lower, output 75.
Index 7 (110): 85 at index 6 is nearest lower, output 85.

### 2

#### Input
5
50 50 50 50 50

#### Output
[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

#### Explanation
All values are equal, so no strictly lower previous value exists for any element.

## Input Format
The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the data sequence.

## Output Format
Return array of integers. The i-th integer should be the value of the nearest element j < i such that val_j < val_i. If no such element exists, return -1.

## Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ val_i ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.

## Time Limit
2 second

## Memory Limit
256 MB

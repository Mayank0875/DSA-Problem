Easy

## Description

A programmer is scanning a sequence of recorded integer values to locate the moment when a previously unseen (forgotten) bit becomes active again. For each position in the sequence, they need to find the attendance number of the nearest future element that has a strictly higher value, indicating that a higher-order bit that was missing earlier has now been set. If there is no such future element (either because it is the last element or all subsequent elements are lower or equal), this should be reported. Can you compute this for every position in the array?

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

8
[500, 400, 600, 300, 700, 450, 800, 500]

#### Output

[600, 600, 700, 700, 800, 800, -1, -1]

#### Explanation

Concert 0 (500): Next higher is 600 (Concert 2). Output 600.
Concert 1 (400): Next higher is 600 (Concert 2). Output 600.
Concert 2 (600): Next higher is 700 (Concert 4). Output 700.
Concert 3 (300): Next higher is 700 (Concert 4). Output 700.
Concert 4 (700): Next higher is 800 (Concert 6). Output 800.
Concert 5 (450): Next higher is 800 (Concert 6). Output 800.
Concert 6 (800): No future concert is higher. Output -1.
Concert 7 (500): No future concert exists. Output -1.

### 2

#### Input

5
50 50 50 50 50

#### Output

[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

#### Explanation

All Attendance are equal, so no future concert has higher attendance.

## Input Format

The first line contains a single integer n, the number of concerts.
The second line contains n space-separated integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_[n-1], representing the audience attendance for each concert.

## Output Format

Return array of integers. The i-th integer should be the attendance of the nearest concert j > i such that a_j > a_i. If no such day exists, then -1.

## Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.

## Time Limit

2 second

## Memory Limit

256 MB

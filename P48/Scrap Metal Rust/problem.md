Scrap Metal Rust

## Slug

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
In a junkyard, piles of scrap metal stand at different heights. Rainwater collects in the gaps between the piles, causing rust. To estimate corrosion risk, the owner wants to know the total volume of water pooling in these gaps. Given the heights of the scrap piles, calculate the trapped water volume.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
12
0 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 2 1

#### Output
6

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6.

### 2

#### Input
6
4 2 0 3 2 5

#### Output
9

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 9.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
- The second line contains n space-separated non-negative integers, representing the profile heights from left to right.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the total accumulated capacity.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 0 ≤ height ≤ 1e9

## Time Limit
2 second

## Memory Limit

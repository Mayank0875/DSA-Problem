## Description

An engineer is monitoring a city's power grid for N hours. The energy consumption for each hour is in array A. To check for surges, they need to find the *peak consumption* (the MAX value) within every K-hour sliding window. After recording all peak values, they compute the XOR sum as a system diagnostic. What is this final value?

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

5 3
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

#### Output

2

#### Explanation

All windows of size 3 are:
    •   [1, 2, 3] → MAX = 3
    •   [2, 3, 4] → MAX = 4
    •   [3, 4, 5] → MAX = 5

Final XOR = 3 ^ 4 ^ 5 = 2

### 2

#### Input

4 2
[5, 1, 3, 2]

#### Output

5

#### Explanation

Windows:
    •   [5, 1] → MAX = 5
    •   [1, 3] → MAX = 3
    •   [3, 2] → MAX = 3

Final XOR = 5 ^ 3 ^ 3 = 5

## Input Format

- The first line contains two integers N (size of array) and K (window size).
- The second line contains N space-separated integers — the elements of the array.

## Output Format

- Return a single integer — the final XOR of all window XORs.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ K ≤ N
- 0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1e9

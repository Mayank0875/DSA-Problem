## Description
A construction crew is paving a square parking zone. They have a specific number of paving slabs, each covering one parking spot. Given the total count of slabs, calculate the maximum side length (in number of spots) of the square parking zone they can pave.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
10

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
3² = 9 ≤ 10, 4² = 16 > 10

### 2

#### Input
25

#### Output
5

#### Explanation
5² = 25 ≤ 25, 6² = 36 > 25

## Input Format
- A single integer x — the total number of slabs available.

## Output Format
- Return single integer — the maximum possible side length r of the square parking zone that can be built using those slabs.

## Constraints
- 0 ≤ x ≤ 1e9

## Description

Given an integer n, where n is odd, consider an n x n grid where each cell (i, j) (for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) contains the product i * j. 
Find the median value when all the elements of this grid are sorted in increasing order.

For example, the 3x3 grid has these products:
    [1, 2, 3]
    [2, 4, 6]
    [3, 6, 9]

When sorted: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 6, 9]. The median (5th element) is 3.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

3

#### Output

3

#### Explanation

The sorted list is [1,2,2,3,3,4,6,6,9]. The median (5th element) is 3.
    
### 2

#### Input

#### Explanation
The sorted list of 25 numbers has median 8.

## Input Format

- The only input line has an integer n.

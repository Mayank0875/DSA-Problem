## Title
Nearest Lower Package Weight

## Slug
nearest-lower-package-weight

## Difficulty
Easy

## Description
You are a logistics coordinator monitoring packages on a conveyor belt. You have a sequence of weights for the packages. To optimize sorting, you need to find the weight of the nearest previous package that was strictly lighter than the current package. This comparison is used to adjust belt speeds dynamically. For each package weight, you need to find the value of the closest preceding package that was strictly lighter. If all previous packages were heavier or equal, you should report that no such package exists. Your task is to compute this for the entire stream of packages.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
8
[100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85, 110]

#### Output
[-1, -1, -1, 60, -1, 60, 75, 85]

#### Explanation
Index 0 (100): No previous value, output -1.
Index 1 (80): 100 is not lower, output -1.
Index 2 (60): 100, 80 are not lower, output -1.
Index 3 (70): 60 is the nearest lower value, output 60.
Index 4 (60): No strictly lower previous value, output -1.
Index 5 (75): 60 at index 4 is nearest lower, output 60.
Index 6 (85): 75 at index 5 is nearest lower, output 75.
Index 7 (110): 85 at index 6 is nearest lower, output 85.

### 2

#### Input
5
50 50 50 50 50

#### Output
[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

#### Explanation
All values are equal, so no strictly lower previous value exists for any element.

## Input Format
The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the data sequence.

## Output Format
Return array of integers. The i-th integer should be the value of the nearest element j < i such that val_j < val_i. If no such element exists, return -1.

## Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ val_i ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.

## Time Limit
2 second

## Memory Limit
256 MB

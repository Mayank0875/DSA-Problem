## Title
Train Car Switching

## Slug
train-car-switching

## Difficulty
Easy

## Description
A train has arrived at the terminal station. To depart in the opposite direction, the order of the cars (represented by characters) effectively reverses relative to the platform.

The data is stored as a string `s`. To configure the train for departure, you must reverse the string.

Your challenge is to reverse the string `in-place`, meaning you must modify the given string (or character array) directly. You are not allowed to use extra space for another array. Your solution must use only `O(1)` (constant) extra memory.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
hello

#### Output
olleh

#### Explanation
The input string `hello` is modified in-place to become `olleh`.

### 2

#### Input
level

#### Output
level

#### Explanation
The input string `level` is modified in-place to become `level`.

## Input Format
- The only input line has a string `s`.

## Output Format
- Return the reversed string without using extra space.

## Constraints
- 3 ≤ s.length ≤ 2000

## Time Limit
2 second

## Memory Limit
256 MB

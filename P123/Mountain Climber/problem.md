## Title
Mountain Climber

## Slug
mountain-climber

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
A climber ascends a cliff face. They can reach the next hold (+1) or lunge to a higher hold (+2). Lunging strains the muscles, preventing back-to-back lunges.

The climber starts at hold 0 and wants to reach hold $n$.

On each move, The climber can climb forward either **1 hold** (+1) or **2 holds** (+2). However, grip strength needs to recover. Therefore, The climber **cannot perform two consecutive +2 lunges**.

Your task is to calculate the number of distinct valid ways The climber can reach hold $n$. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
3

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
The valid paths to reach hold 3 are:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 (+1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 3 (+1, +2)
3. 0 -> 2 -> 3 (+2, +1)

Note: The path starting with +2 is valid as long as the next jump is not +2.

### 2

#### Input
4

#### Output
4

#### Explanation
Valid paths:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 (+1, +1, +2)
3. 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +2, +1)
4. 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+2, +1, +1)

Invalid path:
0 -> 2 -> 4 (+2, +2) is not allowed.

## Input Format

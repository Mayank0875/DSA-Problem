## Description

You are given a string S consisting of lowercase English letters. Your objective is to determine whether S is a palindrome. A palindrome is defined as a string that reads the same forwards as it does backward.
For instance, 'racecar' and 'madam' are palindromes, while 'apple' is not. 
Return 'Yes' if S is a palindrome, and 'No' otherwise.

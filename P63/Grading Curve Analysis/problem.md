## Description
A professor is looking at grade distributions. The possible grades are A, B, C, D, and F. He is interested in sequences of $n$ students sorted by grade performance (from F to A). Note: In this logic, we treat the 5 grades as the 5 ordered elements. Calculate the number of possible sorted grade sequences of length $n$.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
1

#### Output
5

#### Explanation
There are 5 valid sequences of length 1.

### 2

#### Input
2

#### Output
15

#### Explanation
There are 15 valid sorted sequences of length 2 (e.g., aa, ae, ai, ao, au, ee, etc.).

## Input Format
- The input consists of a single integer n, representing the required length/quantity.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the total number of valid sorted sequences.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 50

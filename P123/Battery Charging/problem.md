## Description
A drone flies between checkpoints. It can fly 1 km or boost 2 km. Boosting drains the capacitor, which must recharge with a short flight before boosting again.

The drone starts at checkpoint 0 and wants to reach checkpoint $n$.

On each move, The drone can fly forward either **1 km** (+1) or **2 km** (+2). However, the battery needs to stabilize. Therefore, The drone **cannot perform two consecutive +2 boosts**.

Your task is to calculate the number of distinct valid ways The drone can reach checkpoint $n$. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
3

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
The valid paths to reach checkpoint 3 are:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 (+1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 3 (+1, +2)
3. 0 -> 2 -> 3 (+2, +1)

Note: The path starting with +2 is valid as long as the next jump is not +2.

### 2

#### Input
4

#### Output
4

#### Explanation
Valid paths:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 (+1, +1, +2)
3. 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +2, +1)
4. 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+2, +1, +1)

Invalid path:
0 -> 2 -> 4 (+2, +2) is not allowed.

## Input Format

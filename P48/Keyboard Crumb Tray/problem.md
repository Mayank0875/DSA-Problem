## Title
Keyboard Crumb Tray

## Slug
keyboard-crumb-tray

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
A cross-section of a mechanical keyboard shows keys at different heights. Crumbs and spilled coffee get trapped in the gaps between the keys. Given the height profile of the keys, calculate the total volume of debris that can be trapped between them.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
12
0 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 2 1

#### Output
6

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6.

### 2

#### Input
6
4 2 0 3 2 5

#### Output
9

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 9.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
- The second line contains n space-separated non-negative integers, representing the profile heights from left to right.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the total accumulated capacity.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 0 ≤ height ≤ 1e9

## Time Limit
2 second

## Memory Limit
256 MB

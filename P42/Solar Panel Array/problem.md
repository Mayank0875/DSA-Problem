## Description
An energy company is setting up a new solar farm. They have a specific number of identical square solar panels. For efficiency and wiring purposes, the panels must be arranged in a perfect square grid. Given the total number of panels, find the maximum possible number of panels along one edge of this square grid.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
10

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
3² = 9 ≤ 10, 4² = 16 > 10

### 2

#### Input
25

#### Output
5

#### Explanation
5² = 25 ≤ 25, 6² = 36 > 25

## Input Format
- A single integer x — the total number of solar panels available.

## Output Format
- Return single integer — the maximum possible side length r of the square grid that can be built using those solar panels.

## Constraints
- 0 ≤ x ≤ 1e9

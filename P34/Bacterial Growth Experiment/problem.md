## Description

In a biology lab, $n$ different bacteria colonies (labeled 1 to $n$) are tested with $n$ different nutrients (labeled 1 to $n$). When colony $i$ is exposed to nutrient $j$, its final population size is $i \times j$.A researcher wants to analyze the distribution of all $n^2$ possible outcomes. To do this, they need to find the median population size. Given that $n$ is an odd number, find this median value.

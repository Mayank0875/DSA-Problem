## Title
City Smog Traps

## Slug
city-smog-traps

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
Smog settles in the 'urban canyons' formed by skyscrapers of different heights. The smog layer is trapped up to the height of the surrounding buildings. Given the heights of the buildings in a city block, calculate the total volume of smog trapped in the street canyons.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
12
0 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 2 1

#### Output
6

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6.

### 2

#### Input
6
4 2 0 3 2 5

#### Output
9

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 9.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
- The second line contains n space-separated non-negative integers, representing the profile heights from left to right.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the total accumulated capacity.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 0 ≤ height ≤ 1e9

## Time Limit
2 second

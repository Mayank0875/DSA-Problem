## Description

You are working with a synthetic numeric sequence generated by an algorithm. For each element in the sequence, you need to determine the value of the nearest preceding element that is strictly smaller than the current one. If there is no such preceding element (either because it is the first element or all earlier elements are greater than or equal to it), you should indicate this with -1. This information helps analyze the local decreasing trends within the synthetic data. Compute this value for every position in the given sequence.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

8
[100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85, 110]

#### Output

[-1, -1, -1, 60, -1, 60, 75, 85]

#### Explanation

Day 0 (100): No previous day, output -1.
Day 1 (80): Price 100 on day 0 is not lower, output -1.
Day 2 (60): Prices 100, 80 are not lower, output -1.
Day 3 (70): Price 60 on day 2 is lower, output 60.
Day 4 (60): Prices 100, 80, 60, 70. None are strictly lower, output -1.
Day 5 (75): Price 60 on day 4 is the nearest lower, output 60.
Day 6 (85): Price 75 on day 5 is the nearest lower, output 75.
Day 7 (110): Price 85 on day 6 is the nearest lower, output 85.

### 2

#### Input

5
50 50 50 50 50

#### Output

[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

#### Explanation

All prices are equal, so no strictly lower previous price exists for any day.

## Input Format

The first line contains a single integer n, the number of days.
The second line contains n space-separated integers p_0, p_1, ..., p_[n-1], representing the stock price for each day.

## Output Format

Return array of integers. The i-th integer should be the stock price on the nearest day j < i such that p_j < p_i. If no such day exists, then -1.

## Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ p_i ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.

## Time Limit

2 second

## Memory Limit

A child has $n$ types of red blocks and $n$ types of blue blocks. The blocks of each color are sized 1 to $n$. When a red block of size $i$ is stacked with a blue block of size $j$, the "stability" of the structure is $i \times j$.Find the median stability score from all $n^2$ possible red-blue pairings. You are given that $n$ is an odd number.

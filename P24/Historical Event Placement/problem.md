## Description

You are organizing a timeline of historical events, sorted by year. You have a new event that occurred in a `target` year and you need to insert it into your sorted list.

Your task is to find the correct index for this new event.
The index should point to the first event in the list that occurred in a year greater than or equal to the `target` year.
If all events are from earlier years, this new event is placed at the end.


## Examples

### 1

#### Input

6 8
[2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12]


#### Output

3

#### Explanation

The first product with an ID greater than or equal to 8 is at index 3.

### 2

#### Input

6 6
[2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12]

#### Output

2

#### Explanation

No product has an ID equal to 6.
The first product with a larger ID (7) appears at index 2.

## Input Format

- The first line contains two integers n and target, where n = number of product IDs, and target = ID of the new product.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers — the sorted list of product IDs.

## Output Format

- Return a single integer — the index where the new product should be inserted.



## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ product_id, target ≤ 10^9
- The IDs are sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Title

Corrupted Frame: Nearest Previous Lower Value

## Slug

corrupted-frame

## Difficulty

Easy

## Description

You are processing a sequence of video frames that have been affected by varying levels of corruption. For each frame, you need to determine the corruption level of the nearest previous frame whose corruption level is strictly lower than that of the current frame. If no such previous frame exists (either because it is the first frame or all earlier frames have equal or higher corruption), you should indicate this with `-1`. This information helps in identifying recent points of improvement in the video quality. Compute this value for every frame given the list of corruption levels.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

8
[100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85, 110]

#### Output

[-1, -1, -1, 60, -1, 60, 75, 85]

#### Explanation

Day 0 (100): No previous day, output -1.
Day 1 (80): Price 100 on day 0 is not lower, output -1.
Day 2 (60): Prices 100, 80 are not lower, output -1.
Day 3 (70): Price 60 on day 2 is lower, output 60.
Day 4 (60): Prices 100, 80, 60, 70. None are strictly lower, output -1.
Day 5 (75): Price 60 on day 4 is the nearest lower, output 60.
Day 6 (85): Price 75 on day 5 is the nearest lower, output 75.
Day 7 (110): Price 85 on day 6 is the nearest lower, output 85.

### 2

#### Input

5
50 50 50 50 50

#### Output

[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

#### Explanation

All prices are equal, so no strictly lower previous price exists for any day.

## Input Format

The first line contains a single integer n, the number of days.
The second line contains n space-separated integers p_0, p_1, ..., p_[n-1], representing the stock price for each day.

## Output Format

Return array of integers. The i-th integer should be the stock price on the nearest day j < i such that p_j < p_i. If no such day exists, then -1.

## Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ p_i ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.

## Time Limit

2 second

## Memory Limit

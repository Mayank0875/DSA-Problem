## Description

Deep beneath the lunar caves, miners discover moonstones that naturally form in cubic patterns. However, the surface area of each moonstone chunk is a perfect square only for special batches.

Given two integers L and R, representing the range of moonstone batch IDs, count how many batch IDs form perfect squares.

Avoid using any square root library functions.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

9 25

#### Output

3

#### Explanation

The perfect squares in the range [9, 25] are 9 (3x3), 16 (4x4), and 25 (5x5). There are 3 such numbers.

### 2

#### Input

1 10

#### Output

3

#### Explanation

The perfect squares in the range [1, 10] are 1 (1x1), 4 (2x2), and 9 (3x3). There are 3 such numbers.

## Input Format

The input consists of a single line with two space-separated integers, L and R.

## Output Format

- Return a single integer representing the count of perfect squares in the inclusive range [L, R].

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 10^18

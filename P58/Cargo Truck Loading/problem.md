## Description
A logistics company loads trucks with exactly two crates per compartment. The combined weight of the two crates must equal the compartment's weight rating. Given the weights of available crates, calculate the number of valid loading pairs.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
6 6
1 5 7 -1 5 1

#### Output
6

#### Explanation
Pairs with sum 6:
(1, 5), (1, 5), (5, 1), (5, 1), (7, -1), (1, 5)...
Total valid pairs count is 6.

### 2

#### Input
4 2
1 1 1 1

#### Output
6

#### Explanation
Every combination of two '1's sums to 2. The number of ways to choose 2 items from 4 is 6.

## Input Format
- The first line contains an integer n and `target`, the number of elements and the target sum.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the array.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer — total number of valid pairs.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- -10^9 ≤ target ≤ 10^9
- -10^9 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9

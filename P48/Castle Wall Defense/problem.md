## Description
A medieval castle wall has crenellations (merlons) of varying heights. After a battle, debris and rainwater fill the gaps between the merlons. The king wants to know the volume of material filling these gaps. Given the heights of the stone sections, calculate the total trapped volume.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
12
0 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 2 1

#### Output
6

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6.

### 2

#### Input
6
4 2 0 3 2 5

#### Output
9

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 9.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
- The second line contains n space-separated non-negative integers, representing the profile heights from left to right.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the total accumulated capacity.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 0 ≤ height ≤ 1e9

## Time Limit

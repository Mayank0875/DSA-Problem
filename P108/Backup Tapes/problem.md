Backup Tapes

## Description
A server uses a rotation of backup tapes. The tape used last week is moved to the front to be overwritten today.

The tape set is represented by an array. The daily backup rotates the tapes $k$ positions to the right. A rotation to the right means the last tape moves to the first position, and all other tapes shift one spot to the right. This process happens $k$ times.

Your task is to determine the final arrangement of the tapes in the tape set. You must achieve this efficiently, ideally modifying the structure in-place.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
7 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7

#### Output
5 6 7 1 2 3 4

#### Explanation
Initial: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
Rotate 1: `[7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
Rotate 2: `[6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
Rotate 3: `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

### 2

#### Input
4 2
-1 -100 3 99

#### Output
3 99 -1 -100

#### Explanation
Rotate 1: `[99, -1, -100, 3]`
Rotate 2: `[3, 99, -1, -100]`

## Input Format
- The first line contains two integers, $n$ and $k$, the number of tapes and the rotation count.
- The second line contains $n$ space-separated integers representing the tapes.

## Output Format
- Return the array containing the $n$ integers in their new order, separated by spaces.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^5

## Title
Ice Cream Scoops

## Slug
ice-cream-scoops

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
A tub of ice cream has been scooped out unevenly, leaving ridges of different heights. Chocolate syrup is poured over the top and pools in the dips. Calculate the total amount of syrup that stays on the ice cream surface given the height profile of the scoops.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
12
0 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 2 1

#### Output
6

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6.

### 2

#### Input
6
4 2 0 3 2 5

#### Output
9

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 9.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
- The second line contains n space-separated non-negative integers, representing the profile heights from left to right.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the total accumulated capacity.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 0 ≤ height ≤ 1e9

## Time Limit
2 second

## Difficulty

Easy

## Description

You are given an m x n altitude map. The altitudes (integers) in the map have the following properties:
    1. Each row is sorted, with altitudes increasing from West to East.
    2. The altitude at the start of any row is greater than the altitude at the end of the previous row.

Given a target altitude, return 1 if it exists on the map or 0 otherwise. 
You must write an algorithm with O(log(m*n)) time complexity.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

3 4 3
[[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]]


#### Output

1

#### Explanation

The target 3 first appears in Matrix.

### 2

#### Input

3 4 13
[[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]]

#### Output

0

#### Explanation

The target 13 first appears in Matrix.

## Input Format

- The first line contains two integers m , n and target, the number of rows and columns and target.
- The next m lines contain n integers each, representing the matrix elements.

## Output Format

- Return 1 if the target exists in the matrix, 0.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ matrix[i][j], target ≤ 10^9
- The matrix rows are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

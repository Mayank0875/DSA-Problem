## Description
Architects are building a model pyramid and need to construct the bottom-most layer first, which must be a solid square of stone blocks. Given the total number of stone blocks allocated for the base, find the side length (in blocks) of the largest square base they can build.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
10

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
3² = 9 ≤ 10, 4² = 16 > 10

### 2

#### Input
25

#### Output
5

#### Explanation
5² = 25 ≤ 25, 6² = 36 > 25

## Input Format
- A single integer x — the total number of blocks available.

## Output Format
- Return single integer — the maximum possible side length r of the square base that can be built using those blocks.

## Constraints
- 0 ≤ x ≤ 1e9

## Time Limit

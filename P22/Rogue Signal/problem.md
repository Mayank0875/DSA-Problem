## Description

A space observatory receives a stream of data packets, sorted by their frequency. The system is designed to receive every signal twice (once for verification). However, a rogue signal has been inserted that appears only once. Given the sorted array of signal frequencies, find the frequency of the rogue signal.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

9 
[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 8, 8]


#### Output

2

#### Explanation

In the sequence [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 8, 8], the number 2 appears only once.

### 2

#### Input

7 
[3, 3, 7, 7, 10, 11, 11]

#### Output

10

#### Explanation

In the sequence [3, 3, 7, 7, 10, 11, 11], the number 10 appears only once.

## Input Format

- The first line contains an odd integer n, the total number of signals.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the sorted signal frequencies.

## Output Format

- Return a single integer: the frequency of the signal that appears only once.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ stone_value ≤ 10^9
- The array is sorted.
- Every element appears twice except for one.

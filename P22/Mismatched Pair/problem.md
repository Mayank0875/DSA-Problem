## Difficulty

Medium

## Description

You are given a sorted array of numbers where all elements appear twice, except for one element which appears only once. The paired elements are always adjacent to each other. Your task is to find this single, mismatched element.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

9 
[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 8, 8]


#### Output

2

#### Explanation

In the sequence [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 8, 8], the number 2 appears only once.

### 2

#### Input

7 
[3, 3, 7, 7, 10, 11, 11]

#### Output

10

#### Explanation

In the sequence [3, 3, 7, 7, 10, 11, 11], the number 10 appears only once.

## Input Format

- The first line contains an odd integer n, the total number of elements.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the sorted array.

## Output Format

- Return a single integer: the element that appears only once.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ stone_value ≤ 10^9
- The array is sorted.
- Every element appears twice except for one.

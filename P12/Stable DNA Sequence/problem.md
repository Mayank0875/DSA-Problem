## Description

A biologist is studying a short DNA sequence S, represented by lowercase letters. A sequence is considered "genetically stable" if it reads the same forwards and backward (a palindrome). You must determine if the given sequence S is stable. Return 'Yes' if it is, and 'No' otherwise.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

level

#### Output

Yes

#### Explanation

The string "level" reads the same forwards and backward.
    
### 2

#### Input

adam

#### Output

No

#### Explanation

The string "adam" does not read the same forwards and backward ("mada").  

## Input Format  

- The input consists of a single line containing a string S.
- The string S contains only lowercase English letters (a - z).

## Output Format  

- Return 'Yes' if S is a palindrome, and 'No' otherwise.

## Title
Bird Migration

## Slug
bird-migration

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
A bird flies south. It can flap (1 km) or glide (2 km). Gliding requires updrafts which are spaced out, preventing consecutive glides.

The bird starts at km 0 and wants to reach km $n$.

On each move, The bird can fly forward either **1 km** (+1) or **2 km** (+2). However, updrafts are sparse. Therefore, The bird **cannot perform two consecutive +2 glides**.

Your task is to calculate the number of distinct valid ways The bird can reach km $n$. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
3

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
The valid paths to reach km 3 are:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 (+1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 3 (+1, +2)
3. 0 -> 2 -> 3 (+2, +1)

Note: The path starting with +2 is valid as long as the next jump is not +2.

### 2

#### Input
4

#### Output
4

#### Explanation
Valid paths:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 (+1, +1, +2)
3. 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +2, +1)
4. 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+2, +1, +1)

Invalid path:
0 -> 2 -> 4 (+2, +2) is not allowed.

## Input Format
- The only input line has an integer $n$ — the target km index.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer: the number of ways modulo $10^9 + 7$.

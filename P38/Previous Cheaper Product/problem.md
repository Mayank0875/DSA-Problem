## Description
You are a data analyst for an e-commerce platform tracking the price history of a specific item. The system records the price of the item every time it changes. For pricing strategy analysis, you want to find the price at the nearest previous timestamp that was strictly cheaper than the current price. This helps algorithms determine if the current price hike is sustainable or if it significantly exceeds recent lows. For each price point in the history log, you need to find the value of the closest preceding price that was strictly lower. If no such lower price exists in the history, you must output -1. Your task is to process the price list and return the results.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
8
[100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85, 110]

#### Output
[-1, -1, -1, 60, -1, 60, 75, 85]

#### Explanation
Index 0 (100): No previous value, output -1.
Index 1 (80): 100 is not lower, output -1.
Index 2 (60): 100, 80 are not lower, output -1.
Index 3 (70): 60 is the nearest lower value, output 60.
Index 4 (60): No strictly lower previous value, output -1.
Index 5 (75): 60 at index 4 is nearest lower, output 60.
Index 6 (85): 75 at index 5 is nearest lower, output 75.
Index 7 (110): 85 at index 6 is nearest lower, output 85.

### 2

#### Input
5
50 50 50 50 50

#### Output
[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

#### Explanation
All values are equal, so no strictly lower previous value exists for any element.

## Input Format
The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the data sequence.

## Output Format
Return array of integers. The i-th integer should be the value of the nearest element j < i such that val_j < val_i. If no such element exists, return -1.

## Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ val_i ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.

## Time Limit
2 second

## Memory Limit
256 MB

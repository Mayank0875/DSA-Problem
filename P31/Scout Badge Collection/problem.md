## Description

A scout has a list of $N$ completed tasks, each worth $candidates_i$ points. The list may contain multiple tasks worth the same number of points. To earn a merit badge, the scout needs to submit a set of tasks worth exactly $T$ points. Your task is to find the *total count* of unique combinations of these tasks that sum to $T$. Each completed task from the list may be used *only once*.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

7 8 
[10, 1, 2, 7, 6, 1, 5]

#### Output

4

#### Explanation

The 4 unique combinations are [1, 1, 6], [1, 2, 5], [1, 7], and [2, 6].    

### 2

#### Input

5 5 
[2, 5, 2, 1, 2]

#### Output

2

#### Explanation
The 2 unique combinations are [1, 2, 2] and [5].

## Input Format

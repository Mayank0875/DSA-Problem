## Description
You are an audio engineer analyzing a recording of a concert. You have decibel readings taken every second. To study the dynamic range and crescendos, you need to find the decibel level of the nearest previous second that was strictly quieter (lower value) than the current second. This helps in isolating moments where the volume significantly increased from a recent baseline. For each decibel reading, your objective is to find the value of the closest preceding reading that was strictly lower. If all previous readings were louder or equal, you should output a standard marker. Your task is to calculate this for the entire audio log.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
8
[100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85, 110]

#### Output
[-1, -1, -1, 60, -1, 60, 75, 85]

#### Explanation
Index 0 (100): No previous value, output -1.
Index 1 (80): 100 is not lower, output -1.
Index 2 (60): 100, 80 are not lower, output -1.
Index 3 (70): 60 is the nearest lower value, output 60.
Index 4 (60): No strictly lower previous value, output -1.
Index 5 (75): 60 at index 4 is nearest lower, output 60.
Index 6 (85): 75 at index 5 is nearest lower, output 75.
Index 7 (110): 85 at index 6 is nearest lower, output 85.

### 2

#### Input
5
50 50 50 50 50

#### Output
[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

#### Explanation
All values are equal, so no strictly lower previous value exists for any element.

## Input Format
The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the data sequence.

## Output Format
Return array of integers. The i-th integer should be the value of the nearest element j < i such that val_j < val_i. If no such element exists, return -1.

## Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ val_i ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.

## Time Limit
2 second

## Memory Limit
256 MB

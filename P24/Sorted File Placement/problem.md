## Description

A computer's file system displays files in a directory sorted by their size. You are saving a new file with a `target` size and need to know where it will appear in the list.

Your task is to find the index where this new file should be inserted.
The index should point to the first file that has a size greater than or equal to the new file's size.
If all existing files are smaller, the new file will be placed at the end.


## Examples

### 1

#### Input

6 8
[2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12]


#### Output

3

#### Explanation

The first product with an ID greater than or equal to 8 is at index 3.

### 2

#### Input

6 6
[2, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12]

#### Output

2

#### Explanation

No product has an ID equal to 6.
The first product with a larger ID (7) appears at index 2.

## Input Format

- The first line contains two integers n and target, where n = number of product IDs, and target = ID of the new product.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers — the sorted list of product IDs.

## Output Format

- Return a single integer — the index where the new product should be inserted.



## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ product_id, target ≤ 10^9
- The IDs are sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Description

You've found a pirate's treasure map, which is a grid of letters. A riddle suggests a magic `word` that reveals the treasure's location. Can you trace the `word` on the map? You can move one step up, down, left, or right to an adjacent cell. You cannot reuse the same cell (letter) in your path. Write a function to check if the `word` exists in the `board`.

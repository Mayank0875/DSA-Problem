## Title
Cave Floor Stalagmites

## Slug
cave-floor-stalagmites

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
The floor of a cave is covered in stalagmites of varying heights. During a flood, water pools between the stalagmites. You are given the height profile of the cave floor. Calculate the total amount of water that remains trapped in the depressions after the flood recedes.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
12
0 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 2 1

#### Output
6

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6.

### 2

#### Input
6
4 2 0 3 2 5

#### Output
9

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 9.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
- The second line contains n space-separated non-negative integers, representing the profile heights from left to right.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the total accumulated capacity.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 0 ≤ height ≤ 1e9

## Time Limit
2 second

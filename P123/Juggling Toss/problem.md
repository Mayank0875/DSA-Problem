Juggling Toss

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
A juggler throws balls. They can do a low toss (1 beat) or a high toss (2 beats). High tosses require looking up, disrupting the rhythm if done consecutively.

The juggler starts at beat 0 and wants to reach beat $n$.

On each move, The juggler can toss forward either **1 beat** (+1) or **2 beats** (+2). However, visual tracking is hard. Therefore, The juggler **cannot perform two consecutive +2 high tosses**.

Your task is to calculate the number of distinct valid ways The juggler can reach beat $n$. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
3

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
The valid paths to reach beat 3 are:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 (+1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 3 (+1, +2)
3. 0 -> 2 -> 3 (+2, +1)

Note: The path starting with +2 is valid as long as the next jump is not +2.

### 2

#### Input
4

#### Output
4

#### Explanation
Valid paths:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 (+1, +1, +2)
3. 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +2, +1)
4. 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+2, +1, +1)

Invalid path:
0 -> 2 -> 4 (+2, +2) is not allowed.

## Input Format
- The only input line has an integer $n$ — the target beat index.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer: the number of ways modulo $10^9 + 7$.

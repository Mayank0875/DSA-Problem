A warehouse storage row has pallets with goods (non-zero IDs) and empty floor spaces (`0`). An automated robot pushes all pallets to the loading dock end (start of array) to make them accessible, leaving the empty floor space at the back of the row.

## Examples

### 1

1 3 12 0 0

#### Explanation
The non-zero elements are 1, 3, and 12. They are moved to the front while maintaining their order, and the two 0s are pushed to the end.

### 2

#### Input
1
0

#### Output
0

#### Explanation
There is only one element, which is 0, so no changes are needed.

## Title
Aquarium Gravel Bed

## Slug
aquarium-gravel-bed

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
The gravel bed of an aquarium is uneven, with hills and valleys of varying heights. Debris settles in the valleys between the gravel mounds. To plan cleaning cycles, calculate the total capacity of these debris traps given the gravel height profile.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
12
0 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 2 1

#### Output
6

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6.

### 2

#### Input
6
4 2 0 3 2 5

#### Output
9

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 9.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
- The second line contains n space-separated non-negative integers, representing the profile heights from left to right.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the total accumulated capacity.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 0 ≤ height ≤ 1e9

## Time Limit
2 second

## Memory Limit

## Description

An economist is using an $n \times n$ (where $n$ is odd) matrix to model an economy. The rows $i$ (1 to $n$) represent industries, and the columns $j$ (1 to $n$) represent market sectors. The "growth factor" at $(i, j)$ is $i \times j$.To summarize the model, the economist needs to find the median growth factor from all $n^2$ entries in the matrix.

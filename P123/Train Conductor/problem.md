## Description
A train accelerates. It can throttle up 1 notch or surge 2 notches. Surging stresses the coupling, so it's not done consecutively.

The train starts at speed 0 and wants to reach speed $n$.

On each move, The train can accelerate forward either **1 notch** (+1) or **2 notches** (+2). However, couplings might break. Therefore, The train **cannot perform two consecutive +2 surges**.

Your task is to calculate the number of distinct valid ways The train can reach speed $n$. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo $10^9 + 7$.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
3

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
The valid paths to reach speed 3 are:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 (+1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 3 (+1, +2)
3. 0 -> 2 -> 3 (+2, +1)

Note: The path starting with +2 is valid as long as the next jump is not +2.

### 2

#### Input
4

#### Output
4

#### Explanation
Valid paths:
1. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +1, +1, +1)
2. 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 (+1, +1, +2)
3. 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 (+1, +2, +1)
4. 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (+2, +1, +1)

Invalid path:
0 -> 2 -> 4 (+2, +2) is not allowed.

## Input Format

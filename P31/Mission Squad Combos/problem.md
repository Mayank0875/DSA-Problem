## Description

You are forming a squad for a mission that requires a total power level of $T$. You have $N$ available soldiers, each with a power level $candidates_i$. Your roster of soldiers may include several with the same power level. Your task is to find the *total count* of unique combinations of soldiers that sum to $T$. Each soldier may be selected *only once*.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

7 8 
[10, 1, 2, 7, 6, 1, 5]

#### Output

4

#### Explanation

The 4 unique combinations are [1, 1, 6], [1, 2, 5], [1, 7], and [2, 6].    

### 2

#### Input

5 5 
[2, 5, 2, 1, 2]

#### Output

2

#### Explanation
The 2 unique combinations are [1, 2, 2] and [5].

## Input Format

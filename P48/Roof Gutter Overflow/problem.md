## Title
Roof Gutter Overflow

## Slug
roof-gutter-overflow

## Difficulty
Medium

## Description
An architectural design features a jagged roof with sections of varying heights. Rainwater pools in the dips of the roof design. To verify structural integrity, you need to calculate the total volume of water that sits on the roof before overflowing. Given the profile heights of the roof sections, compute the total water weight.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
12
0 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 2 1

#### Output
6

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6.

### 2

#### Input
6
4 2 0 3 2 5

#### Output
9

#### Explanation
Total trapped units = 2 + 4 + 1 + 2 = 9.

## Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
- The second line contains n space-separated non-negative integers, representing the profile heights from left to right.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the total accumulated capacity.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5
- 0 ≤ height ≤ 1e9

## Time Limit
2 second

## Memory Limit

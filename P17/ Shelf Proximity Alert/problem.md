## Description

A librarian is organizing a shelf with `n` books, each identified by its ISBN (an integer). To prevent confusion, no two books with the `same ISBN should be placed within 'k' spots` of each other. You are given the `Shelf Manifest` as an array of ISBNs. Does the current arrangement violate this rule?

If the rule is violated, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

5
1 0 1 1 3
1

#### Output

true

#### Explanation

The number `1` repeats at indices `2` and `3`, and their distance is `1`, which is ≤ `k (1)`.  
Hence, return `true`. 


### 2

#### Input

6
4 5 6 7 8 4
3

#### Output

false

#### Explanation

The duplicate number `4` appears at indices `0` and `5`.  
The distance between them is `5`, which is greater than `k (3)`.  
Therefore, return `false`.

## Input Format  

- First line: integer `n` — the size of the Cipher Sequence.  
- Second line: `n` space-separated integers — elements of the Cipher Sequence.  
- Third line: integer `k` — the maximum allowed distance between two duplicate numbers.

## Output Format  

Return `true` if there exist two identical numbers within distance `k`, otherwise print `false`.  



## Constraints  

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e4  
- −1e9 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 1e9  
- 0 ≤ k ≤ 1e5

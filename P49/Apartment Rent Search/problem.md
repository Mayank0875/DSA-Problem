## Description
A real estate website lists apartments sorted by monthly rent. A user filters for apartments with a minimum budget. The website needs to scroll to the first listing that is priced at or above the user's minimum budget. Find the index of this listing.
The data is sorted in non-decreasing order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
6 8
2 5 7 8 11 12

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
The first element greater than or equal to 8 is 8, which is at index 3.

### 2

#### Input
6 6
2 5 7 8 11 12

#### Output
2

#### Explanation
There is no element 6. The first element greater than 6 is 7, which is at index 2.

## Input Format
- The first line contains two integers n and target, the number of elements and the value to search/insert.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the sorted sequence.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the index (0-based) of the first element that is greater than or equal to the target. If all elements are smaller, return n.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ value, target ≤ 10^9
- The sequence is sorted in non-decreasing order.

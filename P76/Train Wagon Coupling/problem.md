## Description
A train has `n` wagons with different cargo loads. They are grouped into `k` distinct blocks for braking control. The 'braking heat' generated by a block is the square of its total cargo mass.

You must partition the sequence of wagons into exactly `k` non-empty contiguous blocks.
Each block corresponds to a brake system.
The "braking heat" for a brake system is calculated as the **square of the sum** of the masses of the wagons in that block.

Your goal is to minimize the total braking heat (the sum of the braking heat values of all `k` blocks).

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
8 3
2 3 1 2 2 3 4 1

#### Output
110

#### Explanation
We partition the wagons into 3 blocks: `[2, 3, 1]`, `[2, 2, 3]`, and `[4, 1]`.
The sums are 6, 7, 5.
The total braking heat is $6^2 + 7^2 + 5^2 = 36 + 49 + 25 = 110$.

### 2

#### Input
5 1
1 2 3 4 5

#### Output
225

#### Explanation
Only 1 block is allowed, containing all wagons. Sum = 15. braking heat = $15^2 = 225$.

## Input Format
- The first line contains two integers `n` and `k`: the number of wagons and the required number of blocks.
- The second line contains `n` integers representing the masses of each wagon.

## Output Format
- Return one integer: the minimum total braking heat.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3000
- 1 ≤ value ≤ 10^5

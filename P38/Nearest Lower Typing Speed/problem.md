Nearest Lower Typing Speed

## Description
You are developing a typing tutor software that tracks a user's words per minute (WPM) for each completed lesson. To provide positive feedback, you want to show the user the WPM of the nearest previous lesson where they typed strictly slower than the current lesson. This highlights their immediate improvement. For each lesson's WPM score, you need to find the WPM of the most recent prior lesson that was strictly lower. If no such lesson exists (e.g., the user is performing worse than ever or maintaining a high speed), you should output a standard value. Your task is to calculate this for all lessons.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
8
[100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85, 110]

#### Output
[-1, -1, -1, 60, -1, 60, 75, 85]

#### Explanation
Index 0 (100): No previous value, output -1.
Index 1 (80): 100 is not lower, output -1.
Index 2 (60): 100, 80 are not lower, output -1.
Index 3 (70): 60 is the nearest lower value, output 60.
Index 4 (60): No strictly lower previous value, output -1.
Index 5 (75): 60 at index 4 is nearest lower, output 60.
Index 6 (85): 75 at index 5 is nearest lower, output 75.
Index 7 (110): 85 at index 6 is nearest lower, output 85.

### 2

#### Input
5
50 50 50 50 50

#### Output
[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

#### Explanation
All values are equal, so no strictly lower previous value exists for any element.

## Input Format
The first line contains a single integer n, the number of elements.
The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the data sequence.

## Output Format
Return array of integers. The i-th integer should be the value of the nearest element j < i such that val_j < val_i. If no such element exists, return -1.

## Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ val_i ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.

## Time Limit
2 second

## Memory Limit
256 MB

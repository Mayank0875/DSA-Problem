Packet Repeater

## Slug

packet-repeater

## Difficulty

Easy

## Description

A network router has received `n` packets and stored their unique IDs in a `Packet Log`. A "replay attack" is suspected if `any packet ID appears at least twice` in the log `within a distance of 'k' positions` from each other. Your task is to scan the packet log for this specific sign of an attack.

If a replay attack is detected, return `true` otherwise, return `false`.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

5
1 0 1 1 3
1

#### Output

true

#### Explanation

The number `1` repeats at indices `2` and `3`, and their distance is `1`, which is ≤ `k (1)`.  
Hence, return `true`. 


### 2

#### Input

6
4 5 6 7 8 4
3

#### Output

false

#### Explanation

The duplicate number `4` appears at indices `0` and `5`.  
The distance between them is `5`, which is greater than `k (3)`.  
Therefore, return `false`.

## Input Format  

- First line: integer `n` — the size of the Cipher Sequence.  
- Second line: `n` space-separated integers — elements of the Cipher Sequence.  
- Third line: integer `k` — the maximum allowed distance between two duplicate numbers.

## Output Format  

Return `true` if there exist two identical numbers within distance `k`, otherwise print `false`.  



## Constraints  

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 1e4  
- −1e9 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 1e9  
- 0 ≤ k ≤ 1e5

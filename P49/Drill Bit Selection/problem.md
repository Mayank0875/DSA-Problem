## Difficulty
Easy

## Description
A carpenter needs to drill a hole of a specific diameter. They have a set of drill bits sorted by size. If the exact size is missing, they must use the next larger size to ensure the bolt fits. Find the index of the first drill bit that is at least as large as the required diameter.
The data is sorted in non-decreasing order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
6 8
2 5 7 8 11 12

#### Output
3

#### Explanation
The first element greater than or equal to 8 is 8, which is at index 3.

### 2

#### Input
6 6
2 5 7 8 11 12

#### Output
2

#### Explanation
There is no element 6. The first element greater than 6 is 7, which is at index 2.

## Input Format
- The first line contains two integers n and target, the number of elements and the value to search/insert.
- The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the sorted sequence.

## Output Format
- Return a single integer representing the index (0-based) of the first element that is greater than or equal to the target. If all elements are smaller, return n.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ value, target ≤ 10^9
- The sequence is sorted in non-decreasing order.
